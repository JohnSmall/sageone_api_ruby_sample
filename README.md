# Sage One Ruby API Sample application

Sample application that integrates with Sage One Accounting via the Sage One API.

Authentication with Sage One is handled in the [Sage One Controller](app/controllers/sage_one_controller.rb).

We use the [SageOneApiRequestSigner](https://github.com/Sage/sageone_api_request_signer) to sign our API requests.
